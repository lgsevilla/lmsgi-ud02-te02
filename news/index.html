                    <h3>Critical Role Announces Campaign 4</h3>
                    <p><small>Community · Critical Role · <time datetime="2025-10-01">Oct 1, 2025</time></small></p>

                <p>
                    The cast of Critical Role has confirmed that Campaign 4 will explore a fresh corner of Exandria,
                    blending brand-new cultures with threads that longtime fans will recognize. The table teased an
                    opening arc that focuses on discovery over destiny, with Session 0 emphasizing collaborative
                    worldbuilding, safety tools, and a renewed focus on character boundaries. While plot specifics
                    remain under wraps, the team hinted at experimental encounter design that puts social stakes on
                    equal footing with combat, plus a soundtrack that leans into regional instruments and choral motifs.
                    New viewers are encouraged to jump in here: the production will reintroduce setting foundations,
                    factions, and pantheons without requiring previous campaign knowledge. For Dungeon Masters, the
                    big takeaway is tone—expect slower burns, morally gray choices, and plenty of room for table-driven
                    surprises. Merch drops, art reveals, and a post-premiere Q&A are also planned to support community
                    onboarding and content creation. If you’ve been waiting for the “right” time to hop aboard, this is it.

                    <h3>Keep on the Borderlands Returns as a Modern Starter Set</h3>
                    <p><small>Products · Wizards of the Coast · <time datetime="2025-10-01">Oct 1, 2025</time></small></p>

                    Wizards of the Coast is revisiting the iconic <em>Keep on the Borderlands</em> with a modernized
                    starter set aimed at welcoming first-time players while still delighting veterans. The new package
                    includes streamlined rules, pre-built characters with session-zero prompts, and modular encounter
                    paths that scale from one-shots to a full mini-campaign. Classic locations like the Keep, the
                    wilderness approaches, and the infamous Caves receive updated maps with clearer sightlines and
                    read-aloud text optimized for beginner DMs. Treasure and magic items have been reframed to reward
                    exploration and problem-solving instead of pure combat throughput, and the bestiary highlights
                    behaviors that support stealth, parley, or creative tactics. A digital companion offers printable
                    condition trackers, safety tool reference sheets, and a low-prep “first hour” walkthrough. The goal
                    is simple: help any group sit down, pick a hook, and start adventuring within minutes—no experience
                    required. For tables seeking a nostalgia hit with contemporary quality-of-life improvements, this set
                    looks like a strong on-ramp.

                    <h3>Unearthed Arcana: Psionic Themes Return to the Playtest</h3>
                    <p><small>Rules · Unearthed Arcana · <time datetime="2025-10-01">Oct 1, 2025</time></small></p>

                <p>
                    The latest Unearthed Arcana brings psionic-flavored options back into the spotlight, focusing on
                    subtle, mind-first gameplay rather than raw damage scaling. Expect disciplines that emphasize
                    battlefield intuition, emotion-tinged illusions, and short-burst utility that expands what a party
                    can attempt between traditional spell slots. The designers note they’re testing “decision density,”
                    ensuring psionic choices feel meaningful without overwhelming players who prefer a lighter touch.
                    Several class archetypes receive test features that reward careful positioning, readied reactions,
                    and teamwork combos—think predictive shields, sensory pings, and contested-will challenges that
                    resolve quickly at the table. Feedback will drive tuning on proficiency interactions, concentration
                    pressure, and multiclass clarity. If your group enjoys creative problem solving and social intrigue,
                    these options are a compelling sandbox. As always, UA material is playtest content—bring your notes,
                    try it in a one-shot, and tell the devs what sings.
